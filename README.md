# Pageturns

## Elevator Pitch

Pageturns is an application which helps people plan and manage their reading. It will serve as a place for users to log their progress and make notes on individual reading sessions. Keeping track of your reading will motivate you to finish and reinforce your understanding/memory. The application can compile statistics based on your reading, and provide estimates of how long a book will take to read based on your reading rate.
